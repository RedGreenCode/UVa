# UVa Online Judge Solutions

I'm working my way through the suggested UVa problems in [Competitive Programming 3](https://sites.google.com/site/stevenhalim/) by Halim and Halim. Some of the code I write in the process of solving these problems will end up in this repository. For more information on this learning project, see [About Project 462](http://www.redgreencode.com/about-project-462/).
